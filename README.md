# Car Prise Prediction
## Description
> Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive
a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that
can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.
We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of
different makes and models across cities in the United States. Our results show that Random Forest
model and K-Means clustering with linear regression yield the best results, but are compute heavy.
Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower
training time in comparison to the aforementioned methods.

# Car Prise Prediction
## Description
> Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.I implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models across cities in the India with respect of year of which car was purchase. Our results show that Random Forest model is best among all the model

## Motivation for this project 
> Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult.Several factors, including car model, kilometer driven, year of purchased, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately[2-3]. Based on existing
data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.
